summary: |
  I've been for a decade a profesor and a researcher on Audio and Music Software Engineering
  and an specialist in Agile and Free/Libre Open Source Software Development methods.
  I have been teaching mostly at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, but also other universities, an activity that I enjoy a lot.
  Currently I am involved in several cooperatives of the Social Economy,
  currently working at Som Energia and GuifiBaix SCCL,
  a local Guifi.net deployer.
  I also have many contacts and bounds to many other entities such as
  Som Connexio, Mes Opcions, Coop57, Pam a Pam...
  
  Although my formal education is mostly technical, my interests go on a wide range of topics
  from Biology and Physics to Politics, History, Economy and Philosophy.
  Indeed I have been always interested the social part of Computer Science,
  Free Software communities, its internal dynamics, and
  their struggle to reach the masses in rivalry with powerfull monopolies.
  After the 15M upraising in Barcelona, I decided to focus my efforts
  on constructing, supporting and promoting social economy iniciatives
  applying lessons learnt in the software community and, indeed learning a lot.

#  I am a researcher specialized in domains like 3D Acoustics, Music Information Retrieval and Audio Software Engineering.
#  My current research is related to 3D Acoustics.
#  Some research topics I recently faced are:
#  Chord extraction
#  visual prototyping of audio applications
#  real-time convolution
#  3D virtual scenario acoustics simulation
#  binaural reproduction of acoustic environments...
#  I also have a long software development experience on desktop, web and server applications, and related to audio and multimedia.
#  I have strong experience using agile methodologies and open source tools and methods.
#  Some technologies I recently hacked with are Qt, C++, Python, Django, PHP, SCons, JACK, ALSA, PortAudio, Linux, bash, OpenGL...
#  I have been teaching, mostly to higher school students, since 1995
#  an activity I enjoy a lot, and I like to innovate about.

  title: "Layout Remapping Tool for Multichannel Audio Productions"
  author: "Tim Schmele, David García-Garzón, Umut Sayin, Davide Scaini and Daniel Arteaga"
  notes: "134th Audio Engineering Society Convention; May 2013; Parma, Italy"
  year: "2013"
  url: "http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16807"
  abstract: |
    Several multichannel audio formats are present in the recording industry with reduced interoperability among the formats.
    This diversity of formats leaves the end user with limited accessibility to content and/or audience.
    In addition, the preservation of recordings—that are made for a particular format—comes under threat, should the format become obsolete.
    To tackle such issues, we present a layout-to-layout conversion tool that allows converting recordings
    that are designated for one particular layout to any other layout.
    This is done by decoding the existent recording to a layout independent equivalent
    and then encoding it to desired layout through different rendering methods.
    The tool has proven useful according to expert opinions.
    Simulations depict that after several consecutive conversions the results exhibit a decrease in spatial accuracy and increase in overall gain.
    This suggests that consecutive conversions should be avoided and only a single conversion from the originally rendered material should be done.

This extends the power of the framework in many ways. Some of them are exploring and manipulating live processing networks via interactive Python shells, or extending the power of visual prototyping in CLAM by adding elaborated application logic and user interfaces with PyQt/PySide. The described Python API, ipyclam, by redefining the back-end layer, can be reused to control other patching based systems such as JACK, gAlan...

  title: "Determining a room geometry from its impulse response"
  year: "2010"
  notes: "Presented at Internoise10, Lisbon, June 2010."
  abstract: This paper reports on the development of a system to characterize the geometric properties of a space from an acoustic impulse response measured within it. This can be thought of as the inverse problem to the common practice of obtaining impulse responses from either a real-world or a virtual space. Starting from a measured or synthesized impulse response in an original scene, the method described here defines a space of possible scenes and a distance measure on it, and discusses a strategy to select a scene from this space, which is perceptually as close as possible to the original one. Potential applications of this novel method include audio forensics, re-equalization and re-mixing of music and audio.

  title: "Estimating 3D Camera Motion for Rendering Audio in Virtual Scenes"
  year: "2009"
  notes: "5th European Conference on Visual Media Production, 2008."
  abstract: |
    In the production phase of digital cinema content it is important to allow the director not only to preview the final rendered scene early in the shooting process, but also to prehear the 5.1 surround and HRTF-based binaural versions, thus enabling visual and auditive artistic decisions to be taken at the shooting stage. In many cases camera tracking data is not available for all cameras on the set (e.g. handheld ones) and thus the motion of the camera needs to be estimated. In this paper we describe an approach for estimation of 3D camera motion and its use for real-time audio rendering.

  title: "Combining multi-level audio descriptors via web identification and aggregation"
  year: "2009"
  notes: "Presented at World Wide Web Conference'09, Developers Track, Madrid"
  abstract: |
    In this paper, we present the CLAM Aggregator, a tool included in the CLAM framework that allows combining multi-level audio descriptors. The tool includes a reliable method to identify the user’s local music collection using open data resources and allows users to configure, aggregate and edit music information ranging from low-level descriptors to any metadata from the semantic Web. All these steps are designed in a flexible, graphical, and user-adaptive way.

  title: "Real-time 3D audio for digital cinema"
  year: "2008"
  notes: "ASA Conference ACOUSTICS'08 Paris."
  abstract: |
    We present a real-time 3D audio system with a number of nice features: it is suited for plausible reference with the visual environment, it is real-time capable, it can process multiple moving sound sources and listeners in a normal CPU. In our approach, a database of pressure and velocities impulse-responses (IRs) is computed offline for each (architectural) environment using physically based ray-tracing techniques. During playback, the real-time system retrieves IRs corresponding to the sources and target positions, performs a low-latency partitioned convolution and smoothes IR transitions with cross-fades. Finally, the system is flexible enough to decode to any surround exhibition setup. The software has been developed within the CLAM open-source audio framework. We present a real scenario where these techniques were successfully applied: an augmented-reality film with 3D audio within the context of the IP-RACINE project for digital cinema. The shooting was done with a high-end prototype camera with zoom and position tracking which enabled the real-time motion of a subjective listener within the scene. Our technology enabled the film director to both pre-hear surround audio of an augmented-reality scene shooting and fine-tune audio rendering in post-production.

#    A product I developed when I was working on Cards Engineering.
#    It is a web based collaborative application to share and annotate CAD files from several TDM-like systems.
#    Besides developing the product, I deployed the company development infrastructure
#    to meet agile development requirements.
#    The system was successfully implanted on Ford Ibérica, CASA, and Metro de Madrid.

    PyVitae is a python script to define curriculum vitae using a simple 
    text based syntax and generating several outputs including html and pdf.
    Like WiKo, it follows a write-once-generate-many principle.
    This curriculum has been generated using it.

  description: >-
    A computer simulation of evolutive biological systems developed as my Technical Engineering Project.
    A multiplatform implementation in C++, highly configurable to simulate
    different scenarios, varying physical and biological rules.
    You can play with genic expresion mechanisms and phenotipical interactions
    including codon decoding, intron and exon zones, promoter zones, multiple chromosomes
    several kinds of mutations...
    Simulations provide insight of emergent life features such as
    self regulation of mortality and aging,
    family bounds, depredation, symbiosy,
    and adaptation to periodical environment changes (day/night, seasons, longer cycles).
